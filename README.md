# MovieRecommendationSystem
This project is a movie recommendation system built using Python. It was created as part of a Python training course to help learners understand key programming concepts such as list, loop and dictionary.

Features
The movie recommendation system project has the following features:


User input: users can provide their preferences for different movie attributes such as genre, year, rating, etc.
Recommendation algorithm: the system uses a simple recommendation algorithm to suggest movies that match the user's preferences.
Output: the system outputs the recommended movies to the user.

Limitations
This movie recommendation system project was created for learning purposes and has the following limitations:

It does not use object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
It uses a simple recommendation algorithm and may not produce the best recommendations for all users.
It only uses a small dataset of movies and their attributes.
Conclusion
This movie recommendation system project is a simple example of what you can achieve with Python programming. It covers basic concepts such as list, loop and dictionary and can be used as a starting point for more advanced projects. Feel free to use and modify this project as you see fit!
